# Ethiopian-Calander-Python-EXE-for-Fastings-day-and-Holidays"
"Ethiopian Calendar Python EXE for Fastings-day and Holidays" is a Windows application (EXE file) developed using Python code designed to calculate fasting days (·åæ·àû·âΩ·äï) and holidays (·â£·ãê·àã·âµ·äï) based on the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church algorithm known as Bahire Hasab. This algorithm is a centuries-old method used to determine the dates of religious observances in the Ethiopian Orthodox calendar.

## Key Features:
User Interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a specific Ethiopian calendar year (·ãì·àò·â∞ ·àù·àÖ·à®·âµ) and receive calculated dates for important fasting periods and holidays.

####     ‚úÖ Welcome page

####     ‚úÖ Year Provided

####     ‚úÖ Anno Domini

####     ‚úÖ Dynamic and Static Calculations

Specific computing numbers like Wengelawewu, Medebe, Wenber, Abeqete, Meteqe, Metene-rabit, and Metene-sabit.

Specific fasting days like Tsome-nenewe, Abiye-tsome, Tsome-hawariyat, and Tsome-dihnete

Specific religion holidays: Debre-zeyet, Hosahena, Seqelete, Tensae, Rekebe-kahenat, Erget, and Perakletos
